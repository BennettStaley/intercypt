## Javascript Based MITM attack demo
(because i really like js, and all the demos are in python :smileyface: )

### This method requires PORTS (macports) which can be found here:
https://www.macports.org/install.php

Alternatively if you are running linux:
```
apt-get -y install dsniff
apt-get -y arp-scan
```
will suffice
